# Healthcare-Chatbot
A Chatbot based on sklearn where you can give a symptom and it will ask you questions and will tell you the details and give some advice.In this Project we used Supervised Machine learning,The **Decision-Tree Classifier** Algorithm was used to train the model. The datasets available was in .csv format and _Pandas_ library was used to read the files.
# Procedures to run the program
## Run Locally
###  For Backend Program

```python chat_bot_template.py```

2.If the command prompt or gitbash cannot run the above command,then open Visual Studio Code or any other editor and run the program 
```python chat_bot_template.py```
